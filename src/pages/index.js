            production and garment manufacturing are equipped with worldwide
            known best brand machines and equipments (Japan Pegasus, Juki,
            Kansai and other known brands) allowing to have merely a high
            quality production. The company has been functioning not so long as
            of today but it already has its unique place in the market and is a
            leader in textile production. The company’s primary target is to
            clean Armenian market from cheap and low quality products by
            developing local production as well as introduce Armenian high
            quality products in foreign markets.

                A textile is a flexible material made by creating an
                interlocking network of yarns or threads, which are produced by
                spinning raw fibres from either natural or synthetic sources
                into long and twisted lengths.

                As the TTC supply air diffuser has all of the sensors built in
                to the diffuser and does not require any installation on the
                walls, extremely high flexibility and simple management are
                obtained when walls are to be built, moved or removed.
